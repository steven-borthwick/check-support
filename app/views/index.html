        <p><span style="font-weight: 800">Problem:</span> agents can't easily advice users if they can improve their pension by paying gaps. It involves a separate tool and a call back, even when some users can't improve their pension.</p>
      <p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 800">Hypothesis:</span> showing agents if users can improve their pension with clear info and simple messaging will mean that they can answer enquiries at the point of contact.</p>
